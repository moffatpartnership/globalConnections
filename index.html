            <p>We have compared your DNA to about four thousand people from around the world and plotted how you are related genetically. Each circle represents a reference individual, someone with known ancestry, colour coded according to where they come from, and your DNA is represented by the larger pink circle. In each plot the genetic differences between people are summarised in two dimensions, so the nearer any two circles are to one another, the more similar they are genetically. People from the same population tend to also be close to each other genetically, and geographically neighbouring populations are often genetic neighbours as well.</p>

            <p>The plots are described in more detail below.</p>
